I studied mathematics in [UPC-FME](https://fme.upc.edu/es) (Barcelona) specializing in data science. I worked as a **teacher assistant** in industrial ingeneering at [UPC-ETSEIB](https://etseib.upc.edu/ca) for roughly 2 years. I taught Linear Algebra, Geometry, and Calculus. Also, I worked at [IRI](https://www.iri.upc.edu/) as an **undergraduate researcher** for 1 year and a half. I worked on deep generative models for images (using Deep Learning), comparing state-of-the-art methods. This ended up being my Bachelor Thesis, which you can find in the projects section. I also did a **mobility program** in Lausanne [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/), specializing in data science. Currently, I am working at [Methinks](https://www.methinks.ai/), using AI for stroke diagnosis. Among my responsabilities: R&D of new deep learning models, design and analysis of clinical studies, etc.
