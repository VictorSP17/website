## Studies

I am finishing my mathematics degree in [UPC-FME](https://fme.upc.edu/es) (Barcelona) and self-studying data science. I want to learn about the world through data science and solve relevant problems for the social good.

## Relevant experience

I worked as a **teacher assistant** in industrial ingeneering at [UPC-ETSEIB](https://etseib.upc.edu/ca) for roughly 2 years. I tought Linear Algebra, Geometry, and Calculus. Also, I worked at [IRI](https://www.iri.upc.edu/) as an **undergraduate researcher** for 1 year and a half. I worked on deep generative models for image generation (Deep Learning), comparing state-of-the-art methods. This ended up being my Bachelor Thesis, which I will make public soon. Right now I am in a **mobility program** in Lausanne [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/) finishing my elective courses, specializing in data science.
